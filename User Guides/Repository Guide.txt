1) Each development group has their own branch. This is the branch that every member's changes will ultimately be merged into. This will be the most up-to-date branch for their respective group.

2) Each member must create their own branch. The following commands in the terminal will create your own branch, and pull your group's branches files.
      git branch INSERT_NAME
      git checkout INSERT_NAME
      git pull origin GROUP_NAME
      
     
2) Each group member must communicate with their manager BEFORE any merging to their group branch is done.
3) Merges to main must be coordinated with all of the managers of each group, to ensure that everybody's code is up-to-date, and no issues will arise from uncoordinated mergings.
4) Ensure all code in each branch is documented.
5) Any time you push changes to a branch (your own, group branches, or to the main branch), you must comment the changes, or additions to the branch.
The following commands in the terminal will allow you to comment your changes, and push.

      git add INSERT_FILE/DIRECTORY
      git commit -m "I have changed X, and have added Y"
      git push origin MEMBER_NAME

6) Managers of the licensing team and style guide team may commit to the main branch when making changes to the licensing and style guide documents.
