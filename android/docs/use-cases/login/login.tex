\section{Description}
Lets a user log in to the app, and verifies their identity before giving them access to any personal data.

\section{User}
A user of the Android version of AlarmBuddy. This user should already have an account created.

\section{Preconditions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item No one is currently logged in to this instance of the app
		\item User already has an AlarmBuddy account
	\end{itemize}

\section{Main Scenario}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item App displays the login screen, which contains fields for the username and password
		\item User enters their username and password correctly
		\item App verifies that username and password match a valid AlarmBuddy account in our records
		\item App permits user access and opens the home screen of the app
	\end{enumerate}

\section{Alternate Success}
	\subsection{Logging in on a new device}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item User attempts to log in to their account on a device they've never used before
			\item User successfully logs in as described in Main Scenario
			\item App sends a security notification to the user, letting them know about the new device sign-in
		\end{enumerate}
\section{Exception Cases}
	\subsection{User enters password incorrectly}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item App displays login screen
			\item User types in a valid username with an incorrect password
			\item App informs user of the incorrect password, and prompts them to try again
			\item Repeat steps 2 and 3 three times
			\item If the user incorrectly types their password a third time, the device should enforce a timeout period and prevent access
			\item The app should logs a security incident and notify the account holder of a potential breach
		\end{enumerate}
	\subsection{User does not exist}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item App displays login screen
		\item User types in an invalid username and any password
		\item App informs the user that the account they are trying to access does not exist
		\item App allows user to try again with a different username
	\end{enumerate}
\section{Postconditions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item User is logged in to their account
	\item Upon successful login, the user should be navigated to their personalized home screen
	\item The user should not have access to anyone elses account
\end{itemize}

\section{Frequency of Use}
This use case occurs whenever a user logs in on a new device, or whenever they log out of an existing device and log back in. We can expect this to occur somewhat frequently.
